# Simulate Survival Outcome with Controlled Censoring Proportion

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of this repository is to provide a tutorial, as well as _R_ functions, to simulate survival outcomes with controlled censoring proportion following @Wan2017. Particularly, we are interested in simulate survival outcomes (both _surviving time_ and _censoring status_) followed  Weibull distributions (for _event time_ and _censoring time_), where the exponential distribution can be considered as a special case of the weibull distribution. As a part of the tutorial, we examine if the simulated data generated with the proposed method/R function has the anticipated censoring proportion. The simulation study was constructed using the R workflow package [targets](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/targets/index.html).  


# Background
When running extensive simulation studies for survival outcome with (right-)censoring, tuning of the censoring distribution is required and labor intensive. @Wan2017 proposed a numeric method to estimate the parameters of censoring distributions given the hazard distribution and covariate data, which greatly improves the automation of survival simulation studies. A closed-form calculation is provided for limited scenarios, but we focused on the numeric method for the purpose of generalizability. Specifically, we focus on the case where hazard and censoring distributions are Weibull distributions with different parameters, i.e. different shape $k$ and scale $\lambda$. In theory, this should also work for cases where the distributions are exponential, which is equivalent to a Weibull(1, $\lambda$), or Weibull with the same shape parameter $k$ for both  hazard and censoring distributions. We don't (and probably won't) provide support for the Gumpertz distribution (another common hazard distribution).

In the simulation study, we focus on examining the following factors: censoring proportions $\pi \in \{0.15, 0.3, 0.45\},$ [TODO: expand to more factors, e.g. sample size, ]. For each combination of the factors, we run 1000 replications.
